# grid-auto-flow

When you explictly define columns and don't define rows, they are automatically created as implicit rows.

`grid-auto-flow` lets you determine, when you need to add an extra grid item, whether it will be added as a row or column.

By default, new items are added as rows but `grid-auto-flow: column` lets you add new items as columns.

This could be used for a section that you wish to be horizontally scrolling.
