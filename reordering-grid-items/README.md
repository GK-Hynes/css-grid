# Reordering Grid Items

CSS Grid has an `order` property.

The default order of everything is 0.

By giving grid items an order you can arrange when they appear in the grid. In the example below, the logo is set to `order: 2;` and the nav is set to `order: 1;`

They will appear in that order even though the logo comes before the nav in the HTML.

This will affect your ability to select or tab through items so be careful.
